      <description>In the spirit of Ben Horowitz’s Good Product Manager/Bad Product Manager, here’s my attempt at Good Manager/Bad Manager, summarizing lessons from my ten years trying to get this right.
Good managers are all about their teams. They measure themselves through the successes of their teams. They are tirelessly driving to create environments where the team members are fully engaged and doing great work. Good managers remove obstacles and create room. Good managers work to understand and develop each worker as individuals.</description>

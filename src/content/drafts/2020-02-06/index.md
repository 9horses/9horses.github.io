To be clear, I think the (Agile Manifesto)[https://agilemanifesto.org/] was a great step forward. 

But in the 19 years since its inscription, "Agile" has basically become the de facto "software development process" primarily based on its promise to deliver software faster.

I've recently posted about Cargo Cult - a descriptor for the act of following a process without understanding why the process leads to the desired result.

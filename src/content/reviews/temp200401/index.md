Shinichi is indeed a technology expert with a great deal of experience, going well beyond just AWS. He immediately came up with several options for solving my problem. We actually ended up working together to create the most efficient solution and we're going to be sharing it in a blog article. He is responsive, professional, and thoughtful. I've learned a great deal simply by asking him some questions.

I highly recommend Shinichi and I look forward to working with him in my future projects.

      <description>(Ceremonial cross of John Frum cargo cult, Tanna island, New Hebrides (now Vanuatu), 1967) There&amp;rsquo;s a growing trend today in using &amp;ldquo;Cargo Cult&amp;rdquo; as an adjective to form various idioms, most likely started by Richard Feynman in this speech to coin &amp;ldquo;Cargo Cult Science&amp;rdquo;.
It loosely means &amp;ldquo;form without material&amp;rdquo;, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually much more than that. Here&amp;rsquo;s Feynman&amp;rsquo;s description of Cargo Cult:

      <description>The Great American Eclipse is less than a week away.
The hype for this particular event is partly due to the large swath of places (mostly across the United States) where one may witness the so called ‘totality.’ This is when the moon covers the entire sun, producing the ‘total’ eclipse.
During totality, the sun is completely covered, and it gets as dark as night. And you can actually see the corona surrounding the sun as in the image above.</description>

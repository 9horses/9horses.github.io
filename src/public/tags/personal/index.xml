      <description>People often ask me what my first name (Shinichi) means, as it is unusual outside of Japan. But I’ve always struggled a bit in answering this simple question.
In Japan, naming a newborn is serious business. Many Japanese can tell you several reasons behind their names, and how those reasons come together in meaningful ways. So explaining a name is not so simple. It’s a story.
My name also has a little story behind it.</description>

      <title>Why I drink beer out of the bottle</title>

      <description>I have a friend who always insists on having his beer poured into a glass to drink.
I on the other hand almost always drink out of the bottle. (Though, yes, with polite company, I do try to act move civilized.)
It’s not laziness that I do this — it’s actually hero worship, for my dad.
You see, my dad grew up in post-war Japan. Life was hard back then. He grew up in a neighborhood in Osaka that had mostly burned down during the war.</description>
